<div class="insper">Ever since the emergence of the first car in the 19th century, millions of cars have been produced by hundreds of car brands. Some brands evolved with time and became industry giants, while others were left behind in the race for excellence. Brands that welcomed technology as a whole worked for decades to make a name in the industry. The years of hard work have paid off and now their launches are highly anticipated, with pre-bookings portraying people’s trust in the brand’s name. Speaking of trusted brands that have built a reputation with decades of experience under their belt, Volkswagen’s name will be right up there with the top ones.
